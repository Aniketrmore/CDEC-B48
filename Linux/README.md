# Day-4 : Mastering the Linux Prompt

## Understanding the Linux Command Prompt
The Linux command prompt is a powerful interface for interacting with your operating system. It allows users to execute commands, manage files, and perform administrative tasks efficiently. The prompt typically looks like this:
```
username@hostname:~$
```

### Key Components:
- **Username**: Your current user account.
- **Hostname**: The name of the computer.
- **Current Directory**: The directory you're working in (e.g., `~` for the home directory).
- **Prompt Symbol**: `$` for standard users and `#` for the root user.

## Decoding the Structure of the Command Prompt
Understanding the elements of the command prompt helps you navigate and operate more effectively:
- **`~`**: Represents the user's home directory.
- **`pwd`**: Displays the current directory.
- **`whoami`**: Reveals the current user.
- **`hostname`**: Shows the machine's name.

## Effective Command Prompt Usage: A Step-by-Step Guide
1. **Navigating Directories**:
   - `cd` to change directories.
   - `ls` to list files and directories.
   - `pwd` to print the working directory.

2. **Managing Files**:
   - `touch filename` to create an empty file.
   - `mkdir dirname` to create a new directory.
   - `rm filename` to delete a file.

3. **Getting Help**:
   - `man command` to view the manual for a command.
   - `--help` for a quick command reference (e.g., `ls --help`).

4. **Running Commands as Root**:
   - Use `sudo` before commands to execute with administrative privileges.

## Making the Command Prompt Your Own: Customization Tips (Advanced Concept)
You can personalize your command prompt to suit your workflow:

### Customizing the Prompt:
Edit the `.bashrc` file in your home directory:
```bash
PS1='\u@\h:\w\$ '
```
- `\u`: Username
- `\h`: Hostname
- `\w`: Current working directory

### Adding Colors:
Add colors to differentiate sections of your prompt:
```bash
PS1='\[\033[01;32m\]\u@\h\[\033[00m\]:\[\033[01;34m\]\w\[\033[00m\]\$ '
```

- **`ls`**: Lists files and directories.
- **`cp`**: Copies files.
- **`mv`**: Moves or renames files.
- **`rm`**: Removes files or directories.
- **`chmod`**: Changes file permissions.

## Getting Started with the Linux Terminal
The Linux terminal is your gateway to managing the system. Start with:
- **Opening the Terminal**: Use `Ctrl + Alt + T` on most distributions.
- **Typing Commands**: Enter commands and press `Enter` to execute.

### Tips for Beginners:
- Use `Tab` for auto-completion.
- Use `Up` and `Down` arrow keys to cycle through command history.

## Essential System Information: Commands and Tools for Linux
Learn commands to retrieve system details:
- **`uname -a`**: Displays system information.
- **`df -h`**: Shows disk space usage.

# Day 5: Delving Deep into the Linux File System

## Navigating the File System
Understanding how to navigate the Linux file system is fundamental to using the operating system effectively. The Linux file system is organized as a hierarchy, starting from the root directory `/`.

### Key Commands for Navigation:
- **`pwd`**: Prints the current working directory.
- **`cd`**: Changes the current directory.
  - Example: `cd /home/user` navigates to the user's home directory.
  - `cd ..` moves one level up in the directory hierarchy.
  - `cd -` returns to the previous directory.
- **`ls`**: Lists the contents of a directory.
  - Options:
    - `ls -l`: Detailed list view.
    - `ls -a`: Shows hidden files (those starting with `.`).

## File and Directory Management
Linux provides powerful commands for creating, renaming, and organizing files and directories.

### Creating Files and Directories:
- **`touch filename`**: Creates an empty file.
- **`mkdir dirname`**: Creates a new directory.
  - Use `mkdir -p /path/to/dir` to create nested directories.

### Renaming Files and Directories:
- **`mv oldname newname`**: Renames files or directories.
  - Example: `mv file1.txt file2.txt` renames `file1.txt` to `file2.txt`.

### Viewing Directory Structure:
- **`tree`**: Displays a tree-like structure of directories (if installed).
  - Example: `tree /home/user`.
- **`ls -R`**: Lists directory contents recursively.

## Viewing and Editing Files
Linux offers several tools for inspecting and modifying files.

### Viewing Files:
- **`cat filename`**: Displays the contents of a file.
- **`less filename`**: Views file contents one page at a time.
  - Navigate with the `Up`/`Down` keys and press `q` to quit.
- **`head filename`**: Displays the first 10 lines of a file.
- **`tail filename`**: Displays the last 10 lines of a file.
  - Use `tail -f filename` to view live updates (e.g., log files).

### Editing Files:
- **`nano filename`**: Opens the file in a simple text editor.
  - Save changes with `Ctrl + O`, and exit with `Ctrl + X`.
- **`vim filename`**: Opens the file in the Vim editor (advanced users).
  - Press `i` to enter insert mode, `Esc` to exit insert mode, and `:wq` to save and quit.

## Copy, Move, and Delete Files
Efficiently manage files using the following commands:

### Copying Files:
- **`cp source destination`**: Copies files or directories.
  - Options:
    - `cp -r`: Copies directories recursively.
    - `cp -i`: Prompts before overwriting existing files.

### Moving Files:
- **`mv source destination`**: Moves files or directories to a new location.
  - Example: `mv file1.txt /home/user/docs`.

### Deleting Files:
- **`rm filename`**: Deletes a file.
  - Use `rm -i` for confirmation before deletion.
  - **`rm -r directory`**: Deletes a directory and its contents.
  - **`rm -rf directory`**: Forcibly deletes a directory without prompting (use with caution).

## Conclusion
Mastering the Linux file system commands will make navigating, managing, and editing files more efficient. Practice these commands regularly to build confidence and streamline your workflow.
