```
ls /
```

## Understanding the Functionality of Common Linux Directories
Each directory in Linux has a specific function. Here is a breakdown of some important ones:

### Common Directories:
- **`/bin` and `/sbin`**:
  - Contain essential system utilities and binaries.
- **`/lib` and `/lib64`**:
  - Shared libraries needed by binaries in `/bin` and `/sbin`.
- **`/opt`**:
  - Optional software packages.
- **`/mnt` and `/media`**:
  - Mount points for external drives and devices.

### Hands-On:
Navigate and inspect the contents of these directories to understand their role:
```
cd /etc
ls -l
```

## Introduction to Linux Shortcuts: Boost Your Efficiency
Linux provides several shortcuts to improve efficiency while navigating the file system and executing commands.

### Common Shortcuts:
- **`~`**: Refers to the current user’s home directory.
- **`.`**: Represents the current directory.
- **`..`**: Represents the parent directory.
- **`/`**: Refers to the root directory.

### Shortcut Examples:
- Navigate to the home directory:
  ```
  cd ~
  ```
- Move up one level in the directory tree:
  ```
  cd ..
  ```
- Combine shortcuts for quick navigation:
  ```
  cd ~/Documents
  ```

### Tips for Efficiency:
- Use **Tab Completion** to auto-complete file and directory names.
- Leverage **`alias`** to create shortcuts for frequently used commands.
  - Example:
    ```
    alias ll='ls -l'
    ```

# Day 9: Managing Users and Permissions in Linux

## Overview of User and Permission Management
User and permission management is essential for securing a Linux system and controlling access to resources. This involves creating, modifying, and managing users, groups, and permissions to ensure proper access control.

### Practical:
1. Identify the current user:
   ```bash
   whoami
   ```
2. View all users on the system:
   ```bash
   cat /etc/passwd
   ```

## Types of Users
Linux categorizes users into:
1. **Root User**: The administrator with full system access.
2. **System Users**: Used for system processes and services.
3. **Regular Users**: General users with restricted permissions.

### Practical:
1. Check the root user:
   ```bash
   id root
   ```
2. Identify system users:
   ```bash
   less /etc/passwd | grep -v "/home"
   ```

## Using `useradd` Command
The `useradd` command creates new user accounts.

### Syntax:
```bash
useradd [options] username
```

### Options:
- `-m`: Create a home directory for the user.
- `-s`: Specify the default shell.
- `-G`: Add the user to supplementary groups.

### Practical:
1. Add a new user:
   ```bash
   sudo useradd -m -s /bin/bash john
   ```
2. Verify the user:
   ```bash
   id john
   ```

## Setting User Passwords
Set or change a user password using the `passwd` command.

### Practical:
1. Set a password for a user:
   ```bash
   sudo passwd john
   ```
2. Test login with the new credentials.

## Managing User Groups
Groups simplify permission management by categorizing users.

### Commands:
- `groupadd`: Create a new group.
- `usermod -aG`: Add a user to a group.
- `groups`: Display groups a user belongs to.

### Practical:
1. Create a new group:
   ```bash
   sudo groupadd developers
   ```
2. Add a user to the group:
   ```bash
   sudo usermod -aG developers john
   ```
3. Verify group membership:
   ```bash
   groups john
   ```

## Removing Users
Delete a user account using the `userdel` command.

### Practical:
1. Remove a user:
   ```bash
   sudo userdel john
   ```
2. Remove a user and their home directory:
   ```bash
   sudo userdel -r john
   ```

## Introduction to Affected Files
Several system files are affected during user and permission management:
- `/etc/passwd`: Stores user account details.
- `/etc/shadow`: Stores encrypted passwords.
- `/etc/group`: Stores group details.

### Practical:
1. View the contents of `/etc/passwd`:
   ```bash
   cat /etc/passwd
   ```
2. Check group details:
   ```bash
   cat /etc/group
   ```

## User Home Directories
Each user has a dedicated home directory for personal files, typically located in `/home/username`.

### Practical:
1. View a user’s home directory:
   ```bash
   ls /home
   ```
2. Access another user’s home directory (as root):
   ```bash
   sudo ls /home/john
   ```

## Configuration Files
User-specific settings are stored in configuration files within their home directories, such as `.bashrc` and `.profile`.

### Practical:
1. Edit `.bashrc` for a user:
   ```bash
   nano /home/john/.bashrc
   ```
2. Apply changes:
   ```bash
   source /home/john/.bashrc
   ```

## Switching Between Users in Linux
Switching users is necessary for testing or administrative tasks.

### Using `su` Command
The `su` command switches to another user account.

### Practical:
1. Switch to another user:
   ```bash
   su john
   ```
2. Return to the previous user:
   ```bash
   exit
   ```

### Using `sudo` Command
The `sudo` command allows running commands as another user, typically root.

### Practical:
1. Run a command as root:
   ```bash
   sudo apt update
   ```
2. Verify `sudo` privileges:
   ```bash
   sudo -l
   ```

## Conclusion
Understanding and managing users and permissions is critical for Linux system administration. By practicing these concepts, you can effectively control access and maintain system security.
